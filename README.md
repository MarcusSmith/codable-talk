The code is broken into separate commits for each stage of the talk. 

You can see the code from each stage by checking out the corresponding commit.

For convenience these have also been tagged by the step number they were:

0: Starting Point  
1: Decode JSON data  
2: Encode to JSON data  
3: Decoding with Dates / formats  
4: Coding Manually  
5: Example command line app with custom EnvironmentDecoder  
6: Using userInfo  
7: Codable Type using single value containers  
8: Codable Type using unkeyed value containers  

Happy Coding!
